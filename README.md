# Remove Image Sizes

Remove Image Sizes is a simple WordPress plugin that allows removing image sizes that WordPress automatically generates during the upload process. Use this plugin together with my other plugin, [Tiny Compress](https://github.com/maazjes/tiny-compress), for full scale image optimization.
